# O_O

This Repo makes it so whenever you type,

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Left-My-Game/O_O/refs/heads/main/O_O.txt

inside your command prompt it shows a big ASCII version of the classic O_O face. As far as i know this only works on windows devices but it could work on linux or/and mac.
