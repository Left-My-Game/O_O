# Curl ASCII Art

This repository has tons of diffrent ASCII art that you can print within your command line. Just type:

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Left-My-Game/O_O/refs/heads/main/O_O.txt

And replace the O_O.txt with any other txt files in this repository, just note the README.md doesnt count or work.

*Note that this may not work on apple or linux, you'll have to test it out.
